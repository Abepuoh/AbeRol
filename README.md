<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project comes after years of role-playing. One of the shortcomings of this minority sector is the <b>lack of tools</b>,
especially <b>focused more on the Role Master</b> (the individual in charge of making the whole game work perfectly). This task is certainly complicated if you want to be carried out in a serious and professional way as it demands a lot of skills, not only when it comes to developing the story, but also to 
to manage a lot of data which are key for the development of the story and the players themselves.




<!-- Technologies used -->

<!-- STATUS -->
### PROJECT STATUS  

The project is currently at an early stage of development. It is not yet possible to edit the players of each Role and it would be necessary to correct code errors and make the code as clean and simple as possible.
