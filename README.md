<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project comes after years of role-playing. One of the shortcomings of this minority sector is the <b>lack of tools</b>,
especially <b>focused more on the Role Master</b> (the individual in charge of making the whole game work perfectly). This task is certainly complicated if you want to be carried out in a serious and professional way as it demands a lot of skills, not only when it comes to developing the story, but also to 
to manage a lot of data which are key for the development of the story and the players themselves.
